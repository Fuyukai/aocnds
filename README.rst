Advent of Code 2024
===================

This is my attempt at solving Advent of Code 2024 on the Nintendo DS. This is able to complete
the first half of the first day's puzzle, and output it to the screen.

Untested on real hardware, but I see no reason it wouldn't work.

Building
--------

Building can be done with `Just <https://just.systems/>`_. Also requires 
`ndspacker <https://github.com/Fuyukai/ndspacker>`_ and its requirements.

.. code-block:: bash

    # Spit out a rom
    $ just
    # Or, start a debugging session
    $ just gdb
